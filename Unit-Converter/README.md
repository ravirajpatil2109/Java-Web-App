# Unit Converter

## Overview
The **Unit Converter** is a simple web application that allows users to convert between different units of measurement. It supports converting units of **length**, **weight**, and **temperature**. The user can input a value, select the units to convert from and to, and the application will display the converted value.

## Features
- Convert between various units of length, weight, and temperature.
- Supports the following units:
  - **Length**: millimeter, centimeter, meter, kilometer, inch, foot, yard, mile.
  - **Weight**: milligram, gram, kilogram, ounce, pound.
  - **Temperature**: Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin.
- Separate forms for each unit type, with real-time conversion upon form submission.
- Simple and user-friendly interface for quick conversions.

## How It Works
- The user inputs a value to convert.
- The user selects the units they want to convert from and the units they want to convert to.
- The web app calculates the converted value and displays it on the same page without reloading.
  
The project consists of **three separate web pages**:
1. **Length Conversion Page**: Converts between different units of length.
2. **Weight Conversion Page**: Converts between different units of weight.
3. **Temperature Conversion Page**: Converts between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling of the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Handling user inputs and performing conversion calculations.
- **Backend Language**: Purely frontend.
